# BSS Final Project: Motor Imagery Classification using CSP and LDA

## Overview
This project, Blind Source Separation (BSS) Final Project at the University of Tehran under Dr. Akhavan's supervision (Spring 2023), focuses on classifying motor imagery using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The approach involves analyzing EEG data from the second national Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) competition.

## Objective
The primary objective is to classify EEG recordings from 15 individuals, leveraging CSP and LDA. The project entails a comprehensive understanding of EEG data, feature extraction, classification, and performance evaluation using leave-one-out cross-validation.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises `subj_n.mat` files for each subject (n=1 to 15). Detailed dataset information is in `Recording.pdf`, essential for understanding the recording methods and data structure.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Familiarity with EEG data, signal processing, CSP, and LDA

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Downloading Dataset and installing requirements done in Jupyter Notebook provided
